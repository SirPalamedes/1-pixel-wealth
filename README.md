In this version, I have made two broad changes. First, Elon Musk's net worth surpassed that of Jeff Bezos [in January of 2021](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55578403), making Musk the wealthiest person in the world. Consequently, I have replaced Bezos with Musk in this visualization. I have also updated the dollar amounts to the most recent values wherever possible.
